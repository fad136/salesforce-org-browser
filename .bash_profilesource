I use the org browser to easily retrieve data like layouts and fields (basically, components that i create/edit in the salesforce web UI and then i want to retrieve it to push changes to my git branch). So, I need a tool that does exactly the same thing. The ideal would be a terminal UI that allows to explore the org tree and expand the section that i need to then retrieve the components that I need, starting from Layouts and Objects metadata that are the ones that I need the most for now (but also a web interface would be good, since I am basically switching from terminal to chrome as my current workflow). I don't care about the language, i just care that the program works good and it's dependable, since i would like to share it open source to help other sf devs solve this pain pointsf project retrieve start --metadata 'Layout:Lead*'
